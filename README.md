# Missing Values and Its Treatment

This project focuses on handling **missing values** in datasets and applying different treatment methods to ensure data quality and improve analysis results.

## 📌 Project Overview
Missing values are common in real-world datasets and can significantly affect data analysis and machine learning models.  
This notebook demonstrates techniques to detect, analyze, and treat missing values effectively.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Identification of missing data in datasets  
- Visualization of missing value patterns  
- Techniques for handling missing values:
  - Removal of missing data
  - Mean/Median/Mode imputation
  - Forward/Backward fill
  - Advanced imputation techniques (if applied)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
   ```

## 📊 Dataset
The notebook demonstrates missing value treatment using sample datasets (you can replace with your own data for practice).  

## ✨ Results
By the end of this notebook, you will:
- Understand different strategies for handling missing values  
- Be able to choose appropriate methods based on dataset characteristics  
- Improve data preprocessing for machine learning tasks
